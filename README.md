## Overview

In this module we had some very simple questions, but in order to answer those questions and set up a system that can be reusable we had to take multiple steps. These steps included getting or retrieving the data using json, formatting that information into readable dataframes, generating lists using query methods for both SQLite and SQLAlchemy, applying them to a local host as an http link for presentation. All items used are listed above and examples will be listed below.
